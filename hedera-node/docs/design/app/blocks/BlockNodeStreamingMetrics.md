# Metrics for Block Node Streaming

The consensus node emits several metrics related to interactions with the block nodes. All metrics use the "blockStream"
category. These metrics use the standard metrics implementation used by the consensus node application and no additional
configuration is required to access them.

## Buffer Metrics

These metrics relate to the block buffer and are identified by the prefix "buffer".

## Alerting Recommendations

Alerting rules can be created based on these metrics to notify the operations team of potential issues.

Note: These alerts should only be enabled for consensus nodes that are configured to stream to block nodes (i.e., have a
`block-nodes.json` file on disk).

Utilizing Low (L), Medium (M) and High (H) severity levels, some recommended alerting rules to consider include:

**Buffer**: Alerts related to buffer saturation and backpressure
